    "   - **Categorical Dataset:** Comprises a set of categories or groups. Examples are colors, product categories, and yes/no responses.\n",
    "   - **Time Series Dataset:** Captures data points at successive time intervals. Useful for analyzing trends over time.\n",
    "   - **Image Dataset:** Consists of image files, often used in computer vision tasks to identify patterns or objects.\n",
    "   - **Text Dataset:** Includes collections of words, sentences, or documents, typically analyzed for linguistic patterns or content.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Text Data:**\n",
    "   - Text data is composed of sequences of characters, forming words, sentences, or paragraphs.\n",
    "   - It varies in length and complexity, often containing nuanced linguistic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text vs. Categorical Data:**\n",
    "   - Strings of characters can represent different types of data.\n",
    "   - Categorical data is derived from a predefined set of options, such as 'red' or 'blue', 'yes' or 'no'.\n",
    "   - Text data, however, is more fluid, often forming meaningful phrases or sentences that convey complex ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analyzing Text: Corpus and Documents:**\n",
    "   - Text analysis typically involves examining a large body of text, known as a [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_corpus).\n",
    "   - Within this corpus, each individual text entry, whether an article, social media post, or review, is termed a **document**."

    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**:\n",
    "   - **Tokenization** is the process of splitting each document (text) into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "   - We achieve this by breaking the text at whitespace, punctuation marks, or other delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vocabulary Building**:\n",
    "   - Next, we create a **vocabulary** containing all unique words (tokens) that appear in any of the documents.\n",
    "   - Each word is assigned a unique **index** (usually in alphabetical order).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encoding**:\n",
    "   - For each document, we count how often each word from the vocabulary appears in that document.\n",
    "   - The resulting vector represents the word frequencies (counts) for that document."
