    "# Assignment: Advanced Prompt Engineering and Systematic Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**  This assignment explores **advanced prompt engineering** as both an art and a science. Moving beyond basic instruction-following, you will investigate systematic approaches to prompt optimization, analyze the cognitive and linguistic mechanisms underlying effective prompts, and develop frameworks for evaluating prompt performance across diverse tasks and domains. The focus is on **understanding the theoretical foundations** of prompt engineering while developing practical expertise in optimization techniques.\n",
