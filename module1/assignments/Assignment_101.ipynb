    "# Assignment: Intermediate Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Data Analysis (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**  \n",
    "You have practiced basic web scraping using BeautifulSoup to extract static content from a website. In this assignment, you will go a step further by scraping a more structured dataset (such as a table or a list of items), cleaning the data, and performing simple analysis or visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note:**\n",
    "You are allowed to use any generative AI tool of your preference, as long as you are explicit about how and when/where you have used it to obtain your answers. You will be graded on the quality of your answers and your *understanding* of the concepts. *NOT on the quality of your code*. For example, you can use AI to come up with code solutions for each task, but a detailed explanation of your choices must be given. This includes but is not limited to: (i) what the code does, (ii) output samples if available, and (iii) your analysis. If your code is generated with AI, you should mention it and the name of the AI model used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Instructions and Point Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Choose a Website and Identify Structured Data (2 points)**\n",
    "- Select a website with a clearly structured dataset (e.g., a table of course listings, a list of books, or a set of product reviews). Explain your choice (i.e., Was the subject of the website relevant to you? Was the structure of the HTML easier to deal with? etc.)\n",
    "- Briefly describe the dataset you plan to scrape (structure, fields, and why you chose it).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Scrape Data Using BeautifulSoup (3 points)**\n",
    "- Write Python code to:\n",
    "  - Fetch the webpage using `requests` (1 point)\n",
    "  - Parse the HTML and extract at least **three fields** per item (e.g., title, price, rating). Explain your choice of columns. (2 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Clean and Organize the Data (2 points)**\n",
    "- Convert your parsed data into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "- Perform at least **2 cleaning operations**:\n",
    "  - Convert numeric columns (e.g., remove commas/units)\n",
    "  - Standardize text formats (e.g, convert to lower case)\n",
    "  - Handle missing values (e.g, fill with NaN)\n",
    "  - Anything else that might be needed for your particular data\n",
    "- Give a brief explanation of the cleaning operations performed\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Simple Data Analysis or Visualization (2 points)**\n",
    "- Perform **one** simple analysis or visualization, such as:\n",
    "  - Sort and display top items in a category\n",
    "  - Calculate averages/sums of numeric columns\n",
    "  - Create a bar chart or pie chart to compare categories using matplotlib or seaborn\n",
    "- Give a brief description of the plot and/or summarized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Reflection and Extension (1 point)**\n",
    "- In a short paragraph, answer:\n",
    "  - What challenges did you face compared to the basic example?\n",
    "  - Are there other Python packages (like Scrapy or Selenium) that might help if the site was more complex?\n",
    "  - Suggest one AI prompt you could use with Copilot to help automate or improve your code (e.g., “Generate code to handle pagination in BeautifulSoup”).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Submission**\n",
    "- Submit your Jupyter notebook with:\n",
    "  - Code (well-commented) and descriptions when needed\n",
    "  - Output (data and visualization)\n",
    "  - Reflection paragraph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading Rubric:**\n",
    "| Section                        | Points |\n",
    "|--------------------------------|--------|\n",
    "| Website choice & description   |   2    |\n",
    "| Data scraping (code & fields)  |   3    |\n",
    "| Data cleaning & organization   |   2    |\n",
    "| Analysis or visualization      |   2    |\n",
    "| Reflection & extension         |   1    |\n",
    "| **Total**                      | **10** |\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment builds on your notes by requiring structured data extraction, basic cleaning, and a simple analysis or visualization, while encouraging you to think about next steps and tools for more advanced scraping tasks."
