    "## Assignment: Evaluation and Robustness of Open-Source Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:**  \n",
    "This assignment deepens your practical understanding of *open-source large language models (LLMs)*. Rather than training models from scratch, you will select, use, and robustly evaluate LLMs for text generation, focusing on reproducible experiments and critical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions and Point Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Model Selection and Setup (2 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Review the curated list of **open-source LLMs** in the provided notebook (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 7B, Phi-3 Mini, StableLM 7B).\n",
    "- Select **two different models** (with different architectures/sizes).\n",
    "- Load each model and its tokenizer in code, using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.\n",
    "- Briefly justify your model choices (consider parameter size, hardware requirements, and relevant use cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Prompt Design and Data Augmentation (3 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a base set of **10 distinct prompts** (on a common theme such as university programs, Columbia, MO, or another topic of your choice).\n",
    "- Generate completions from both models using the same set of prompts.\n",
    "- Augment the prompt set by applying at least **two augmentation techniques**:\n",
    "  - Paraphrase (manually or using a paraphrasing model)\n",
    "  - Adding typographical errors or slang\n",
    "  - Varying instruction style or context (e.g., first-person vs. third-person)\n",
    "- For each augmentation, generate completions with both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Qualitative and Quantitative Output Analysis (2 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define appropriate **metrics** for output analysis, such as:\n",
    "  - Length of completion\n",
    "  - N-gram diversity\n",
    "  - Factual accuracy (if applicable)\n",
    "  - Readability scores\n",
    "- Build a **Markdown table** comparing the chosen metrics across models and augmentations for at least 10 samples.\n",
    "- Include sample outputs from both original and augmented prompts for illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Robustness Testing (2 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select a subset of your prompts and **introduce adversarial or noisy edits** (e.g., scrambled words, excessive punctuation, misleading context).\n",
    "- Analyze *performance degradation* or changes in output quality across models using your metrics.\n",
    "- Visualize differences using a plot (e.g., bar chart showing metric differences across original vs. noisy prompts for both models).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Technical Reflection (1 point)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a Markdown cell, answer:\n",
    "  - Which model was more robust to prompt noise/augmentation, and why?\n",
    "  - Which augmentation technique most impacted output quality, and how?\n",
    "  - Suggest another way to further evaluate or benchmark open-source LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook** containing:\n",
    "  - All code and comments for Sections 1–4\n",
    "  - Outputs: completions, metrics, tables, and plots\n",
    "  - Reflection (Section 5)\n",
    "- Use Python libraries: `transformers`, `nltk/textstat` (for readability/scoring), `sklearn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading Rubric:**\n",
