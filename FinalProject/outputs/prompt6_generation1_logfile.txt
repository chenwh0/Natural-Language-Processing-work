Node 6: Fetching recommended data...
Fetched features and values:
PctWater_1 (relevance=0.484033) (Percentage of water area (2010 Census)) = 3597.61254310722
HUC8 (relevance=0.394705) (8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code) = N/A
HUC10 (relevance=0.391133) (10-digit Hydrologic Unit Code) = N/A
HUC6 (relevance=0.380827) (6-digit Hydrologic Unit Code) = N/A
huc12 (relevance=0.374577) (12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code) = 3147



Node 7: Summarizing fetched data...
The data contains information related to water bodies and their respective codes:

- **PctWater_1**: This feature represents the percentage of water area from the 2010 Census, with a relevance score of 0.484033. The corresponding value is 3597.61.
- **HUC Codes**: HUC stands for Hydrologic Unit Code, which is used to identify specific water basins or sub-basins. The data includes various HUC codes with different digit lengths: HUC8, HUC10, HUC6, and huc12. While the relevance scores for these codes are provided (ranging from 0.37 to 0.39), the values for HUC8, HUC10, and HUC6 are not available (N/A), whereas the huc12 code has a value of 3147.
